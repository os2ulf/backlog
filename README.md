## Who can create issues?

You should create an issue when:

- You encounter a bug in the solution  
- You have an idea for a feature further development or improvement

## Before creating an issue – remember to check:

- Have you checked whether an issue already exists for the same problem or idea?  
- Have you ensured that it is not caused by a simple mistake or misunderstanding?

## What happens after you create an issue?
